This is a simple story talk about a UW MADIOSN student's plan to go to movie
in Friday this week. However, They did not noticed that on Friday, they have 5 five Cs homework due. Therefore, 
they have to cancle theri plan. What a wonderful day.

In an attempt to go to the movie, the student started rapidly doing homework. 
Suddently they woke up 8 hours later. All of their homework was completed in 
front of them. They have no memory of it. 

Very confused, the student rose from her bed. She strggled to remeber what had
happened the night before. There were bruises on her arm strangely enough
and it looked like she had been bleeding from her head. She turned on the TV
and to her suprise, she saw herself. It was a news chanel and they had her
picture on the screen with the words wanted criminal under her photo.

Reeling in shock, she reached for her phone to text her other CS 400 friends. 
They weren't responding. Fighting back against the pain on her arms and legs
and with her head still bleeding, she got dressed and went to where she
knew her friends would be.
